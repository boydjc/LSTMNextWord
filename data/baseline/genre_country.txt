TITLE: Body Like A Back Road
ARTIST: Sam Hunt
LYRICS:
Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell off my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can
The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can
We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On the highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can
I'ma take it slow
As fast as I can
Body like a back road
Drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand

TITLE: Speak to a Girl
ARTIST: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill
LYRICS:
She don't give a damn 'bout your Benjamin Franklins
She wants Aretha
She don't really care how you're spending your money
It's all how you treat her
She just want a friend to be there
When she opens her eyes in the morning
She wants you to say what you mean and mean everything that you're saying
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That’s how you get with the lady who’s worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your Mama
Respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl
She don't give a damn 'bout your pride or the lies that you're hiding behind
She just want to feel that you're real
That she's near to the man that's inside
She don't need to hear she's a queen on a throne
That she's more than amazing
She just wants you to say what you mean and to mean everything that you're saying
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That’s how you get with a lady who’s worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your Mama
Respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl
That's how you speak to, speak to her
That's how you speak to, speak to her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That's how
That’s how you get with a lady who’s worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your Mama
Respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl
That's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl

TITLE: Dirt On My Boots
ARTIST: Jon Pardi
LYRICS:
Been up since the crack of dawn
Just trying to paid
Been hotter than a thousand suns
I can't find no shade
Just two more roads and I'm good to go
Yeah, I'm shutting this tractor down
Get me a half an hour for a shave or a shower
And I'll be outside your house
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you're up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots
Hard as I worked all day
I'm gonna work harder loving on you
Spin you all over that dance floor
Right out of them high heel shoes
And when you're ready to quit
Baby, we can slip right out of that barroom door
And when I take you home, don't worry babe
I'm gonna kick them off on the porch
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you're up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots
A little dirty dancing, blue collar romancing
I can get cleaned up if you ask me
But I can only get so fancy
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you're up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots
Got a little dirt on my boots
Got a little dirt on my boots

TITLE: The Fighter
ARTIST: Keith Urban
LYRICS:
I know he hurt you
Made you scared of love, too scared to love
He didn't deserve you
Cause your precious heart is a precious heart
He didn't know what he had and I thank God, oh, oh, oh
And it's gonna take just a little time
But you're gonna see that I was born to love you
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter
Look in the mirror
You're beautiful, so beautiful
I'm here to remind you
You're my only one, let me be the one
To heal all the pain that he put you through
It's a love like you never knew
Just let me show you
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you call
What if I cry?
I promise, I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter
I wanna believe that you got me baby
I swear I do from now until the next life
I wanna love, wanna give you all my heart
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you call
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
What if I cry?
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter

TITLE: Hurricane
ARTIST: Lush & Simon feat. XOV
LYRICS:
Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright
But just your sight had my heart storming
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
Hit me like a hurricane
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking bout us again
If I woulda just layed my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house
But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright
But just your sight had my heart storming
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
You hit me category five
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright
But just your sight had my heart storming
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
Hit me like a hurricane
