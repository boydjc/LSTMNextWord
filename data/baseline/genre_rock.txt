TITLE: Heavy
ARTIST: Linkin Park
LYRICS:
I don't like my mind right now
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah I drive myself crazy
Cause I can't escape the gravity
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy
You say that I'm paranoid
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me
It's not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning round me just the same
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning round me just the same
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy

TITLE: Good News
ARTIST: Ocean Park Standoff
LYRICS:
No, this is not a test
Never was, never will be
You can take my best
It was yours, it was never for me
I'm just looking for something
To get me out of my seat
Something that's true
What did I do?
'Cause every time I turn around
I back down who I am
Tell me why it feels like I'm
Still on the run
I need some good news, baby
Feels like the world's gone crazy
Give me some good news, baby
Give it to me, give it to me
I need some good news, baby
'Cause all the world's gone crazy
I need some good news, baby
Give it to me, give it to me
I've been holding back
When our eyes should be falling free
But it's not having faith
Just believe what you can see
And I'm still looking for something
To get me out of my seat
Something that's true
What can I do?
'Cause every time I turn around
I back down who I am
Tell me why it feels like I'm
Still on the run
I need some good news, baby
Feels like the world's gone crazy
Give me some good news, baby
Give it to me, give it to me
I need some good news, baby
'Cause all the world's gone crazy
I need some good news, baby
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it all or give me up
I won't settle for enough
It's the highs and it's the lows we remember
Give it all or give me up
I won't settle for enough
It's the highs and it's the lows we remember
Remember
I need some good news, baby
Feels like the world's gone crazy
Give me some good news, baby
Give it to me, give it to me
I need some good news, baby
'Cause all the world's gone crazy
I need some good news, baby
Give it to me, give it to me
Give me some good news, baby
I need some good news, baby
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it all or give me up
I won't settle for enough
It's the highs and it's the lows we remember

TITLE: Immigrant Song
ARTIST: Led Zeppelin
LYRICS:
Ah, ah,
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.
The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands,
To fight the horde, singing and crying:
Valhalla, I am coming!
On we sweep with threshing oar,
Our only goal will be the western shore.
Ah, ah,
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
>From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.
How soft your fields so green,
Can whisper tales of gore,
Of how we calmed the tides of war.
We are your overlords.
On we sweep with threshing oar,
Our only goal will be the western shore.
So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins,
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing.

TITLE: Testify
ARTIST: Needtobreathe
LYRICS:
Give me your heart, Give me your song
Sing it with all your might
Come to the fountain and you can be satisfied
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain and let me hear you testify
Into the wild, canyons of youth
Oh there's a world to fall into
Wages will dance, like kids on the moon
Oh I will give myself to you
As soon as you start to let go
Give me your heart, Give me your song
Sing it with all your might
Come to the fountain and you can be satisfied
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain and let me hear you testify
Wave after wave, as he goes too deep
Oh I will build my mystery
As soon as you start to let go
Give me your heart, Give me your song
Sing it with all your might
Come to the fountain and you can be satisfied
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain and let me hear you testify
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain and let me hear you testify
Mist on the mountain rising from the ground
There’s no denying beauty makes a sound
Feet can’t escape it there’s no way to doubt
Mist on the mountain rising all around
Give me your heart, Give me your song
Sing it with all your might
Come to the fountain and you can be satisfied
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain and let me hear you testify
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain and let me hear you testify

TITLE: Love Is Mystical
ARTIST: Cold War Kids
LYRICS:
And when my heart won't break
An empty space between my lungs
And when my knees won't shake
I'll drink to find inspiration
Cause I'm a red blooded man
But I can't see behind the sun (I can't see behind the sun)
A supernatural plan
Is coming to meet me now
Living life with no need for the brakes
Something happens when I lean on my mistakes
Love is mystical
Love will break the chains
You might feel invincible
And you might be afraid
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again
Cause I'm a rational man
And I can see how far I've come (I can see how far I've come)
But I don't know where to stand
Or who's coming to meet me now
Living life with no need for the brakes
Something happens when I lean on my mistakes
If the words are true
And the words reveal the same
I come alive when I don't even think
Love is mystical
Love will break the chains
You might feel invincible
And you might be afraid
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again
Oh, can't you hear the future is calling
For heaven's sake
It's either hell or high water
Let's get outta this place
I feel your skeptical eyes
On my mental state
I lift my hands to the sky
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes
Love is mystical
Do you feel the same?
Love is irresistible
It's calling out your name
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
To believe again
To believe again
