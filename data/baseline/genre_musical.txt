TITLE: I'm Still Standing
ARTIST: Stephen Sondheim
LYRICS:
Good times and bum times, I've seen them all, and, my dear,
I'm still here.
Plush velvet sometimes, sometimes just pretzels and beer,
but I'm here.
I've stuffed the dailies in my shoes,
strummed ukuleles, sung the blues.
Seen all my dreams disappear,
but I'm here.
I've slept in shanties, guest of the W.P.A.,
and I'm here.
Danced in my scanties, three bucks a night was the pay,
and I'm here.
I've stood on bread lines with the best,
watched while the headlines did the rest.
In the depression was I depressed? Nowhere near.
I met a big financier,
and I'm here.
I've been through Gandhi, Windsor and Wally's affair,
and I'm here.
Amos 'n' Andy, mah-jongg and platinum hair,
and I'm here.
I got through Abie's Irish Rose, five Dionne babies, Major Bowes,
Had heebie-jeebies for Beebe's Bathysphere.
I got through Shirley Temple,
and I'm here
I've gotten through Herbert and J. Edgar Hoover;
gee, that was fun and a half!
When you've been through Herbert and J. Edgar Hoover,
anything else is a laugh.
I've been through Reno, I've been through Beverly Hills,
and I'm here.
Reefers and vino, rest cures, religion and pills,
but I'm here.
Been called a "pinko-commie tool," got through it stinko by my pool.
I should've gone to an acting school, that seems clear.
Still, someone said, "She's sincere,"
so I'm here.
Black sable one day, next day it goes into hock,
but I'm here.
Top billing Monday, Tuesday you're touring in stock,
but I'm here.
First you're another sloe-eyed vamp, then someone's mother, then you're camp;
then you career from career to career.
I'm almost through my memoirs,
and I'm here.
I've gotten through "Hey, lady, aren't you whoozis?
Wow, what a looker you were."
Or better yet, "Sorry, I thought you were whoozis;
Whatever happened to her?"
Good times and bum times, I've seen 'em all, and, my dear,
I'm still here.
Plush velvet sometimes, sometimes just pretzels and beer,
but I'm here.
I've run the gamut, A to Z;
three cheers and, dammit, c'est la vie.
I got through all of last year,
and I'm here.
Lord knows, at least I've been there, and I'm here.
Look who's here.
I'm still here.

TITLE: In The Room Where You Sleep Lyrics
ARTIST: Dead Man's Bones
LYRICS:
I saw something sitting on your bed
I saw something touching your head
In the room where you sleep
In the room where you sleep, where you sleep
You better run, you better run
You better hide, you better hide
You better run
I saw something sitting on your bed
I saw something touching your head
In the room where you sleep
In the room where you sleep, where you sleep
You better run, you better run
You better hide, you better hide
There's something in the shadows
In the corner of your room
A dark heart is beating and waiting for you
There is no open window but the floors still creep
In the room where you sleep
In the room where you sleep, where you sleep
You better run, you better run
You better hide, you better hide
Oh, you better run

Day by day, oh, dear Lord, three things I pray
To see thee more clearly
Love thee more dearly
Follow thee more nearly, day by day
Day by day, day by day
Oh, dear Lord, three things I pray
To see thee more clearly
Love thee more dearly
Follow thee more nearly, day by day

TITLE: Stepsisters' Lament
ARTIST: Rodgers And Hammerstein
LYRICS:
[Charlotte]
Why would a fellow want a girl like her?
A frail and fluffy beauty.
Why can't a fellow ever once prefer
A solid girl like me?
[Gabrielle]
She's a frothy little bubble,
with a flimsy kind of charm.
And with very little trouble,
I could break her little arm!
Oh
[Charlottle]
Oh,
[Both]
Why would a fellow want a girl like her?
So obviously unusual.
Why can't a fellow ever once prefer, a usual girl like me?
[Charlotte]
Her cheeks are a pretty shade of pink.
[Gabrielle]
But no more pinker than a rose's.
[Charlotte]
Her skin may be delicate and soft.
[Gabrielle]
But not any softer than a doe's is!
[Charlotte]
Her neck is no whiter than a swan.
[Gabrielle]
She's only a dainty as a daisy.
[Charlotte]
She's only as graceful as a bird.
[Both]
So why is a feller' going crazy?
Oh, why would a fellow want a girl like her?
A girl whose merely lovely.
Why can't a fellow ever once prefer, a girl whose merely me?
[Gabrielle]
She's a frothy little bubble,
with a frilly sort of air!
[Charlotte]
And with very little trouble,
I could pull out all her hair!
[Both]
Oh, oh!
Why would a fellow want a girl like her?
A girl whose merely lovely.
Why can't a fellow ever once prefer, a girl whose merely me
What's a matter with a man?
What's a matter witch a man?
What's a matter with a man?!

TITLE: For Everything A Reason
ARTIST: Carina Round
LYRICS:
And so they say lord, for everything a reason
For every ending a new beginning
Oh so they say baby, for everything a reason
And so they say baby, for everything a reason
And those who loved before will be brought back together
Yeah those who loved before will be brought back together
And so they say baby, for everything a reason
And so they say baby you will be brought..
...brought back to me
I saw you leaving, I saw the light go out
I saw you leaving
I saw you leaving
And so they say lord, for everything a reason
My house is haunted by wrong desire
And on my skin left the scent of indignation
And so they say baby, for everything a reason
Don't call me back, I had everything I needed
For every lie, honey, the truth lay underneath it
Oh so they say baby, for everything a reason
And so they say baby, you will be brought...
...brought back to me
I saw you leaving, I saw the light go out
I saw you leaving
I saw you leaving
Come back to me
